<p>Our dedicated admin plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth functioning of our system. 
They have the authority to manage various aspects of the system to provide the best 
experience for our customers. Admins can add new event categories to keep our services up 
to date and relevant. They can also add new vendors to our database, ensuring that our 
customers have a wide selection to choose from. When customers make payments for their 
bookings, it's the admin's responsibility to validate these payments, ensuring a secure and 
reliable transaction process. Admins also have access to view and manage customer 
feedback, ensuring that we're constantly improving our services to meet the needs of our 
customers. Additionally, if there are any inquiries or issues that need to be addressed, our 
admin is always ready to handle them promptly and efficiently. </p><br>
